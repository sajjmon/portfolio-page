                <p>Why do I want to spend my professional life as a developer? - Nothing easier explained than that. Every new task I receive is a new challenge. Although, when I create webpages, no job is the same. In my opinion, it is fascinating to be
                    able to build a platform, which is available for all users. It is always a great feeling when I finnish a job succesfully. I just love it. This is the reason why I signed in for several specialisation programmes.</p>
                <p>My name is Simon Bergström, I am 27 years old and I was born and raised in Arboga, a small town in Sweden. In the last twenty years, my life was dedicated to my favorite sport – floorball. In 2010 i moved to Mora, where I played junior
                    league and all the way up to the highest league. Furthermore, I went to the floorball high school and chose the Children and Leisure program. Other floorball-clubs I signed in were in Hagfors, Karlstad, Hudiksvall and Linköping. At
                    the moment, I am playing for Kloten-Dietlikon Jets floorball team.
                </p>
                <p>My friends and family would describe me as a social and communicative person which loves to create relationships. Nevertheless, I am able to work independently and on my own. Due to my sports career I learned to be competitive and ambitious.
                    That characteristic leads to, that I give all my power and energy to reach my goals. Even on stressfull situations I can keep a clear head and find solutions, what makes me a strong leader in several situations. In my times as a teacher
                    I learned to take responsibility for a large number of children in different ages.</p>
